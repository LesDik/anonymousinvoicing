An Anonymoous Invoicing / AAA Proposal for Future Internet Users and Merchants
This project aims to construct an architecture for anonymous Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting (AAA) services online.
Current online Merchant and Banking services make it impossible to buy goods and services without revealing true identity.
This 'AnInv' project will provide an answer, but the following criteria needs to be met for this project to be succesful:
1. The Merchant will know 'WHO' to invoice (authentication)
2. The Merchant will know 'WHO' can access certain services/goods (authorisation)
3. The Customer requires a 'directed' service/product experience (accounting)

The current approaches uses forms, user e-mails, and 'KYC' data to achieve the above.

But cellphone networks, for example, (until recent 'RICA' laws) were able to achieve 'AAA' using only a SIM card. 
'Prepaid' SIM cards not only made it not super easy to 'purchase' a cellphone connection, they also made it easy
to know much data/airtime a SPECIFIC telephony-user had left or had just bought. Cellphone networks, naturally,
had little to no difficulty identifying specific users (using their cellphone numbers) and addressing their 
specific problems. And this was all possible WITHOUT the need for a user to provide all their private data.

Current online merchant gateways, by design, ALWAYS require private user data.
